# MAG format

{% hint style="danger" %}
**The MAG format is deprecated**. The MAG format snapshot will be maintained and updated until July 6, 2022. After that, the [native-format snapshot](../) will be the only one supported.
{% endhint %}

If you're looking for a drop-in replacement to your existing MAG import, you're in the right place. The MAG Format offers most of the same data you'll find in our Standard Format--but presented in a way that will work pretty smoothly with MAG-based pipelines you've already got.

However, although the OpenAlex Format is very close to the same as what you were getting from MAG, there are some important and unavoidable differences--starting with how you [download the data](how-to-download.md). There are also changes to [what data is collected and updated](mag-migration-guide.md), and some minor changes to the [schema](mag-format-schema.md).
