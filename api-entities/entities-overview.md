# Entities overview

The OpenAlex dataset describes scholarly [_entities_ ](entities-overview.md)and how those entities are connected to each other. Together, these make a huge web (or more technically, heterogeneous directed [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph\_theory)) of hundreds of millions of entities and billions of connections between them all.
