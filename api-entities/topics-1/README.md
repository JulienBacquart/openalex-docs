# üóùÔ∏è Keywords

Works in OpenAlex are tagged with Keywords using an automated system based on Topics.

To learn more about how OpenAlex Keywords work in general, see [the Topics page at OpenAlex help pages](https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/keywords).

For a detailed description of the methods behind OpenAlex Topics, see our paper: ["OpenAlex: End-to-End Process for Topic Classification"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDopkhuGieQ4F8gGNj7sEc8WSE8mvLZS/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=106329373929967149989\&rtpof=true\&sd=true). The code and model are available at [`https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-topic-classification`](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-topic-classification).
