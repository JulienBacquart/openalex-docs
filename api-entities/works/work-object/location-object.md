# Location object

The `Location` object describes the location of a given work. It's only found as part of the `Work` object.

Any given work may have multiple [`locations`](./#locations), representing the different places where the work lives (online). The best (closest to the [version of record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version\_of\_record)) copy of a work can be found in the work's [`primary_location`](./#primary\_location). For a peer-reviewed journal article, this would be a full text published version, hosted by the publisher at the article's DOI URL.
