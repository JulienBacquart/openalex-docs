# About the data

## Sources

OpenAlex is not doing this alone! Rather, we're aggregating and standardizing data from a whole bunch of other great projects, like a river fed by many tributaries. Our two most important data sources are [MAG](https://aka.ms/msracad) and [Crossref.](https://www.crossref.org/) Other key sources include:

* [ORCID](https://orcid.org/)
* [ROR](https://ror.org/)
* [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/)
* [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/)
* [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
* [Pubmed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
* [The ISSN International Centre](https://www.issn.org/)
* Web crawls
* Subject-area and institutional repositories from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and everywhere in between
